# HW03A Notes

Upon observing the pattern, I saw that there are two sizes of circles and they are well aligned in a grid. Moreover, big circles only appear where the horizontal and vertical grid positions are both even numbers, and the opposite is true for small circles. 

Therefore, this pattern can be created using a nested for loop containing an if-else.
