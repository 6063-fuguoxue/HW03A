# HW03A Notes

This code is about creating a pattern in Yayoi Kusama style. Yayoi Kusama was famous for her polka dot paintings, sculptures, installations, and so on. 

Upon observing the pattern, I saw that there are two sizes of circles and they are well aligned in a grid. Moreover, big circles only appear where the horizontal and vertical grid positions are both even numbers or both odd numbers. Small circles appear where the horizontal and vertical grid positions are a combination of an odd and an even number. 

Therefore, this pattern can be created using a nested for loop to create the "grid", and an if-else structure inside the nested for loop to control the size of each dot.
